PROBLEMS

Before reporting bugs to me (pen@lysator.liu.se) always first
try the lastest version(s) of Pidentd, available from:

	ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/ident/servers/

Preferable both the latest released, official, version - and
the latest test version (available from the "test" subdirectory).

Also, always make sure to check the FAQ file for common problems,
and the KNOWNBUGS file for known problems.


LACK OF OPERATING SYSTEM SUPPORT

If the problem you are having is that Pidentd complains about
not supporting your operating system, then you (or someone else)
must create a patch and send it to me. I personally can't port Pidentd
to every possibly Unix on this plan. I try to make sure that Pidentd
run on the Unixes available locally (mainly Solaris 2, Linux, SGI, Ultrix,
SunOS 4, AIX, Digital Unix (eh, Tru64Unix or whatever it's called today)
and Dynix 3).


BUG REPORTS

If running the latest version doesn't solve your problem, then send
me a bug report. In that bug report, *always* include the following
information:

	Pidentd version

	System Hardware and Operating System

	Which compiler (and version)

	How Pidentd was invoked

	Exactly what is going wrong, including some way for me
	to repeat that test.
