README file for Pidentd version 3.0

Copyright (c) 1997-1999 Peter Eriksson <pen@lysator.liu.se>

This daemon implements the IDENT protocol as specified in RFC1413
(see the file rfc1413.txt in the doc subdirectory). It can be used
to identify the user who initiated a TCP/IP connection. It should
probably *NOT* be used for general authentication purposes.

This is a more or less complete rewrite compared to version 2.

Features:

	Autoconfiguration via "configure".

	Multithreaded for speed.

	Doesn't have to run as root (after it has opened
 	the kernel devices).

	Has a configuration file (identd.conf).

	Sanity checks for compiled version vs operating
	system it is being run on.

	Can be started from /etc/inittab

	Automatically tries to detect how it was started
	removing the need to specify it on the command line.

See the file "INSTALL" for installation instructions.

If you have problems, please see the "FAQ" file and always 
make sure you have the latest version of Pidentd. The latest
version can always be FTP'd from:

	ftp://ftp.lysator.liu.se/pub/ident/servers/
